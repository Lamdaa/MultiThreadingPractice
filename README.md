# MultiThreadingPractice
In this repository I will be practicing some coscepts of Multi threading 
Here in the code the the output of the code would be as follows:
Hello there currently I am in Thread LAMDA with Thread id: 21 and 1th iteration /n
Hello there currently I am in Thread LAMDA with Thread id: 21 and 2th iteration /n
Hello there currently I am in Thread LAMDA with Thread id: 21 and 3th iteration
Hello there currently I am in Thread LAMDA with Thread id: 21 and 4th iteration
LAMDA with Thread id: 21 and 5th iteration is entering Sleep mode
